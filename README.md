# HI, I'M D0UG

Hi, my name is **Doug**. After a solid 24-year career in both the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Army, I decided to turn my attention to my Community. With a strong Project, Product and Program Management background, my efforts were focused on the development of Community-Based Programs, supporting those programs, and helping organizations reach their goals. Since 2013, I've been involved in nonprofit management at multiple levels through the application of data to tell a story, strategic planning, and partnership development. 

And I'm a pretty serious :biking_man:

Now I'm pivoting my career from the Nonprofit sector to Tech. I'm very interested in Product Management roles, as well as DEV roles that fit my experience.
